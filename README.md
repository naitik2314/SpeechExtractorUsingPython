# SpeechExtractorUsingPython
This Python script will extract audio from your video file and even make a transcript of your Speech in the video in a .txt file

If the video file is in the same direcotry as your main.py, then no need to add your complete path, but if it is not in the same directory, then you need to specify whole path to the video.
